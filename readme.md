## n*n scrambler for rubiks's cube of any arbitrary length
The scrmabler produces scrambles of any arbitrary length for nxn puzzle, which are robust enough for personal scrambles but is not production grade scrambler, I have not taken into consideration of god's length of any puzzle thus provide appropriate length for scrambles to balance good scramble sequence while managing unnecessary complexity that doesn't add any meaning to the hardness of the puzzle.

Uses:
- for personal scramble and practise.
- to visualize how hard the scrambles for higher nxn.
- practise for pre-competition scrambles.
